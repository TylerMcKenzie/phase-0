Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local 
computer to a non-technical person.

-- First, navigate to your GitHub profile. Locate the "plus" icon in the top lefthand corner of the page. Select create new repository in the drop down menu. Next name your repository and make sure your username is in the box under "Owner".  Provide a description if you like of your repository. Next, choose whether the repository is public or private. Initialize with a README, simply select the box and choose your licensing. Click create repository. After you have created your repository navigate to its page and on the righthand side of the screen will be a "HTTP" link. Copy that link and open your command line.  Navigate into the directory in which you wish to store your repository. Once chosen type "git clone (your url here)" and hit enter. You have now cloned your repository to that directory!

Describe what open source means.

-- Open source can have a number of specifications dependent upon the licencing attached to it, but generally open source means that anyone can copy, edit, and share the material attached.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it 
feel like utopia?

-- I am honestly excited to learn more about open source, but that does not mean that I will not keep track of what I make. As much as one can read about Utopia, one knows that it does not exist.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

-- The importance of using licenses is to determine who can use, share, and sell your code. Along with this it can also determine who takes credit for the code.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What 
did you struggle with?

-- In this challenge I had struggled for awhile in switching between braches, but once I figured it out it was quite the "AHA!" 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

-- I have used a forum, on StackFlow, to help me better understand the differences between bash and shell, however I can't remember which.

<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	-Translating into HTML was fun but a little frustrating at times. Some things would be better it they were put into a css file, but we are not there yet.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	-It wasn't too difficult, there are lots of resources online.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	-From what I had originally learned about HTML made it easy-ish to not format in css, but I would have prefered it to formatting within HTML.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	-Its good in the fact that it is a skeleton of your website. It's bad in the fact that you can't create an aesthetically pleasing user experience.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML? 
	-I currently don't have any cool tricks yet for remembering.

###What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

####	The 6 phases of Web Design are; 1. Information Gathering  2. Planning  3. Design  4. Development  5. Testing and Delivery  6. Maintenance

###What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

####	My site's main goal is to tell a little about me as well as chow off my abilities as a web developer. To show my abilities my site will include links, images, appealing fonts and color schemes, along with interactive portions.

###What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

####	My target audience's intersts are most likely, "Hey, can this guy do what I want no matter how difficuly?" or they will care more on aesthetics. And of course I plan on addressing those interests through the display of my home website.

###What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

####	The primary action that the user should take when visiting my website is to do all of the above. When I create a website I want to also create a community that can connect there as well as find what they need. I'm not saying it sould be the best social site out there, but a place where questions can be answered. 

###What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

####	The main things someone should know about design and user experience are what goes together and what works together. What I mean by "what goes together" is in reference to color coordination and template composition. Knowing these will help to create an aethetically pleasing website. Secondly, the importance of "what goes together" is the actual mechanical function of the features of the website. For instance, a bad example would be "let's put the help tab in the middle of the page." Anyone who has used a website knows that if the help tab is smack dab in the middle of the page the workflow of the website will be disrupted.

###What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

####	User experience or UX is  how a person feels when interfacing with a system. It is valuable because if we center our web design around the user the experience will be so much better.

###Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

####	The only part of this challenge that I found to be tedious was making the sitemap. I know that there are applications that provide templates for you, I just don't want to buy one right now so I made mine by hand in Photoshop(Ironically because I already paid for it).

###What is a wireframe?

####	A wireframe is like a template or rough draft of your website.

###What are the benefits of wireframing?

#### 	The benefits from wireframing is that you can plot out your ideas for the website and make changes before you start implementing them.

###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

####	I did for a little while, until I realized that there is no such thing as free wireframes. Just kidding, it was a blast.

###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

#### 	I had revised my wireframe 3 times before I decided to stick with that one. Honestly I don't think that I will ever stop revising my websites, kinda a perfectionist like that.

###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

####	During this challenge I didn't ask many questions. I think that when we move closer to final copies of the websites I'll think of a few questions.

###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

####	I enjoyed the challenge and I found that all around it was tedious to make a wireframe.

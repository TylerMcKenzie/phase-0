How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

	-You can add or remove any of the features attached to to elements of the page. It can better help see how other websites are set up and to help format your site in real time.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
	
	- To resize elements on the DOM you can either edit the existing code in the DOM or add an element in the filter labled "element.style."

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

	-	Absolute: does not need space for the element, instead can be positioned at a specific location relative to its closest positioned ancestor or to the
		containing block. Absolute positioned boxes can have margins, they do not collapse with any other margins.

		Fixed: does not need space for this element. Insteam it can be positioned at a specific position relative to the screen's viewport and does not move when scrolled. When printed, its position should be the same on every page. This value always creates a new stacking context.

		Static: this keyword lets the element use the normal behavior, as in the current position in the flow. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties do not apply.

		Relative: This keword lays out all elements as though the element were not positioned, and then adjust the element's position, without changing layout(thereby leaving a gap for the element where it would have been had it not been positioned). The effect of position:relative on table-*-group, table-row, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined



What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
	
	- Margin is the space outside the element. The border is the space that surrounds the padding, which is the space on all sides between the element and its border.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
	
	- This challenge was pretty fun overall, and I learned some better things that I can apply to my website.

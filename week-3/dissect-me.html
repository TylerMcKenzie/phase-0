What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often?Why?

	- In this challenge I used the nav, main, and footer tags. I use these often because they really improve the readability of the code and how the site is set up.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	
	- Elements get laid out in a linear path starting with nav, articele, aside, figure, section, an element( <p> ), and lastly div(because it has no additional semantics). 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	
	- In this challenge I learned that sublime, aside from its vast hotkey selection, has other cool tools to use for writing extensive code. I think that I will use snippets all the time, especially when recreating headers and footers. I am unsure exactly how to answer this last part but a good shortcut to use is shift+ctrl+M to select everything within the parenthesis. I use it for editing quickly.

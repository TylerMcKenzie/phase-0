<!-- 

What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

  - It is important to know where the file is located in the hiearchy.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
  
  -I used tables and divs to better position the imformation provided

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
  
  - We tagged the body with the css 
      body {
          color:etc;
          etc;
      }
    to make it change color/font.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

  -we chose to use id's and classes. Of course the id's were only used once, while we used the classes multiple times.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

  - I think that our code was cleaner because all our styling was in a separate file completely

What is an Integer? What is a float?

	- An integer is a whole number while a float can be fractions and decimals.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

	- The difference between float and integer division is that integer division returns as an integer,a whole number rounded down, while float division returns as a double, which can be a decimal. A good example to explain this would be as follows. 

	You go to the movies and see half of the movies playing. There are 9 of them in total. So it stands to reason that an equation of this would be: 9/2 = movies you saw.

	Now we can get technical.

	If it were run as a float it would look like this.

		9/2= 4.5

	Mathmatically that's correct but obviously you didn't go see half a movie so we could instead run the equation as an integer.

		9/2= 4

	Pretty simple right?



How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

-Integers are whole numbers while floats are numbers that can be a fraction or decimal.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

-Strings are groupings of words, much like a sentence. I would use them to specify what the code is doing especially because it is not always displayed to the console.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

-Local variables are variables that are placed directly within the Ruby document that you are working in.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

-I think that this was a good review of basic elements of Ruby.

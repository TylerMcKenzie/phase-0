What does puts do?

	- Puts or "put string" is used as an output for ruby code. This however does not return a value, by default it is set to nil, instead it simply streams the output to the terminal.

What is an Integer? What is a float?

	- An integer is a whole number while a float can be fractions and decimals.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

	- The difference between float and integer division is that integer division returns as an integer,a whole number rounded down, while float division returns as a double, which can be a decimal. A good example to explain this would be as follows. 

	You go to the movies and see half of the movies playing. There are 9 of them in total. So it stands to reason that an equation of this would be: 9/2 = movies you saw.

	Now we can get technical.

	If it were run as a float it would look like this.

		9/2= 4.5

	Mathmatically that's correct but obviously you didn't go see half a movie so we could instead run the equation as an integer.

		9/2= 4

	Pretty simple right?

# Create a Playlist from Driver Code

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.


# Pseudocode
=begin

initialize Song class 
initialize Song class to receive two variables
make separate class Playlist that takes a variable number of parameters
Make a method add that takes a number of songs and adds them to the playlist
define a method called num_of_tracks that shows the number of songs in the playlist
define a method that runs the file attached to the song (modeled)
define a method that removes a song and artist from the playlist
define a method that checks to see if the song is in the playlist and returns true or false
define a method that plays all the songs in the playlist

# Initial Solution
# class Song
  
#   def initialize(title, artist)
#     @title = title
#     @artist = artist
#   end

#    def play
#      puts @title
#     sleep(0.5)
#   end
# end

# class Playlist
#   def initialize(*songs)
#     @playlist=Array.new
#     songs.each{|song| @playlist = @playlist.push(song) }
#   end
  
#   def add(*song)
#     @playlist.concat(song)
#   end
  
#   def num_of_tracks
#     return @playlist.length
#   end
  
#   def remove(title)
#     @playlist.delete(title)
#   end
  
#   def includes?(title)
#     @playlist.include?(title)
#   end
  
#   def play_all
#     @playlist.each do |x|
#       x.play
#     end
#   end
# end


# Refactored Solution

# Reflection
=begin

What concepts did you review in this challenge?
-We reviewed making classes and methods that interact with each other.

What is still confusing to you about Ruby?
-Sometimes using methods across classes confuses me.

What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?
-I am going to use more classes and probably add some ruby to my site.
